# Variables
## What is a variable??
<p>
A variable in JavaScript is like a labeled can that holds a piece of information.
A value is the actual piece of data stored inside a variable. It could be a number, text, a list, or even a function.
<p>
##  Declaring valuables in javascript
<p>1.let:it is used for values that are dynamic
   2.const:it is used for  constant values
   <p>
```
let price=20;price is a valuable and 25 is a value
const city=nairobi:city is a variable while nairobi is a value
```

## Declaring vs Initializing
Declaring a variable is creating a value without assigning a value while intializing a variable is assigning initial value at the time of declaration.
<p>
```
declaration
let age;
initialize
let age=25
```

## Rules of naming variables
While naming values use: _ or $ or letter
```
let age=25
let $price=1500
let _score=100
```
