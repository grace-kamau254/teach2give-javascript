# Introduction to Fuctions
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Functions help in writing modular, maintainable and reusable code.

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens; this means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned from other functions, stored in data structures and even created dynamically.

The basic syntax for declaring a function in JavaScript is as follows:

function functionName() {
  // function body
}
function printHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world");
}
To use a function, you must call/invoke the function as shown:

function printHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world");
}

// calling/invoking a function
printHello();
